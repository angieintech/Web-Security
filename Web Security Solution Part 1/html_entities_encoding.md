<h1>HTML Entity Encoding</h1>

<p>HTML entity encoding can help securing websites that use "element.innerHTML" inside their websites. Instead of allowing script tags and other elements be put inside comment boxes and/or forms using an HTML entity encoding method for a specific character such as < will make the beginning part of this tag appear as text and not as an HTML attribute value. </p>
