<h1>Content Security Policy (CSP)</h1>

<p>Content Security Policies are security policies that can help detect and protect websites from getting attacked. Two of these common attacks are Cross-site Scripting (XSS), and data injections. These cyber attacks can be utilized for defacing websites, stealing data, and distribution of malware. In order to use a Content Security Policy, a web server will be configured and also return the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header. </p>

<h2> CSP Syntax </h2>

    Content-Security-Policy: ... </p>
